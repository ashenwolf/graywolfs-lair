Сьогодні випадково натрапив в новинах на цей прекрасний ролик, де діти з Уотвільської початкової школи (Watville Primary School) співають _Iron Maiden – Flight of Icarus_. Так мило… 😎

А пісню їм підібрали… Гарну та надихаючу:

> As the Sun breaks above the ground  
> An old man stands on the hill  
> As the ground warms to the first rays of light  
> A birdsong shatters the still
> 
> His eyes are ablaze  
> See the madman in his gaze
> 
> \[Chorus:\]  
> Fly, on your way, like an eagle  
> Fly as high as the Sun  
> On your way, like an eagle  
> Fly, touch the Sun
> 
> Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears  
> Looks the old man in the eye  
> As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd  
> In the name of God my father I’ll fly
> 
> His eyes seem so glazed  
> As he flies on the wings of a dream  
> Now he knows his father betrayed  
> Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave
> 
> \[Chorus:\]
> 
> \[Chorus:\]
> 
> Fly as high as the Sun
