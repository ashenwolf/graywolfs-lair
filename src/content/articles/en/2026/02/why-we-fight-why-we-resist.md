Develop nuclear deterrence forces and build nuclear submarines, try to rebuild the fleet, and defend against drones.

Europe does its job, we do ours. We must leave the occupied Donbas to the Russians in the most destroyed state possible — so they cannot restart it and, after processing the survivors through "Ballistic Defense Towers," dispatch them to conquer Belarus, then Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Baltic states. And of course, push to the Dnipro line. We don't need any of that. That is why any withdrawal is contraindicated for us. The moment we leave any territory under any pretext, the Russians will move in: first with police units and television, and then it will unfold just like the occupation of the demilitarized Rhineland. And the world will say: "What, do you want nuclear war? They promise not to go any further — we should believe them."

So it's simple. Maybe for some people it's pure instinct, or maybe there's no explanation at all — but I have an explanation. I don't want to live in a dictatorship. I don't want to spend my days guessing which post or which word of mine will land me in a basement. I don't want poison from a tropical frog slipped into my underwear for investigating corruption. I don't want a basement, while the all-consuming masses take out mortgages and collect maternity capital, agreeing decade after decade to see one face in the portrait — a face bloated with fillers and botox.

If we can be forced to withdraw from the belt of fortresses, then we can be forced to withdraw from Zaporizhzhia. Then a buffer zone near Belgorod and Kursk can be arranged: "Well, you surely don't want those savage Ukrainians striking our facilities again? Why would they do that — we just knocked out their district heating plants in the dead of winter, and they're behaving so inhumanely." This is a path to nowhere.

We are selling the body's own immune response: they are not welcome there, all they get is fever and poison. All the while, on free territory, we train white blood cells and phagocytes and send them across the line. And there, for some reason, gauleiters explode and missiles find their way to exactly where they need to go — missiles perhaps manufactured in Europe, just as many millions of shells are, just as millions of drones are. Well, you wanted to "repeat" what your grandfathers did? You wanted European territory and to wash your boots in the Gulf of Finland again?

This is how things work, this is how they happen: tolerance for other cultures must not be confused with the kind of tolerance where the body can no longer mount a defense. Yes, we are fighting a brutal war. Yes, it is hard. Yes, we have hundreds of thousands of wounded and maimed. But we have no choice — a virus is breaking down our doors, one that wants to turn our own organs against us, spinning an alternative history and selling people an eternal tsar in exchange for "at least not the hungry nineties."

We hope to break their backbone through the wallet, when they can no longer recruit hundreds of thousands of people for obscene sums of money; they hope to break us through a shortage of infantry and desertion. The cause is singular: a deranged old man wanted to go down in history as a "gatherer of lands." And in his country, no one was found to stop him — the political field had already been swept clean.

No freemasons, no reptilians, no cunning EU master plans are prolonging this war. We do not leave territory because doing so would make the next war harder for us and easier for them. Those who don't believe there will be a next war can look at how long Russia gnawed at the leg of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth while signing the "Eternal Peace" and kissing the cross — 150 years.

The physical death of the Patrushevs and Putins, or an economic collapse back to the nineties — that is the real end of the war as things stand today. You can accept this, you can deny it, but that is the state of affairs in 2026. It may be easier for you to hear it now — I accepted all of this in 2014 and have been living with it for many years.
